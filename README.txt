Setko Puzzler 67

This is a simple peg jumping puzzle, similar to Peg Solitare. The main
difference is that diagonal moves are allowed too. To start, remove any one peg
(the puzzle is solvable regardless of which peg is removed) and jump over pegs
to remove them. The puzzle is solved when a single peg remains in the designated
goal field.
